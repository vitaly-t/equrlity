# Amplitude

An experimental prototype for Synereo attention economy development.

The backend (server) uses Typescript, NodeJS and PostgreSQL.

The project supports (assumes?) the use of the excellent (and free) Visual Studio Code development tool,
and includes configuration files for that tool.

## Testing current prototype

To experiment, visit: [Synereo Test Prototype](https://synereo-amplitude.herokuapp.com).

There you will be able download the plugin, and instructions are provided as to installing and running it.
Please note that this is currently a demo only.  No "real" Amps are involved.  Also, once we move out of the
prototype stage, the plugin will be made available through the official Google Play Store, and the current 
manual installation procedure will be removed.

## How it Works

If you have a page opened that you would like to invest in, open the extension popup screen with your
chosen tab selected, and choose the amount you wish to invest.  

If the URL of the page has not been Amplified by anyone previously, congratulations!  
You have first-mover advantage!  Simply click on Amplify to make your investment.

If the url has already been Amplified by someone else, you will be offered the option to "Re-Amplify" the
displayed Synereo URL, which amplifies the displayed URL as opposed to the original URL itself.

In either the case, the effect of Amplifying will be to create a Synereo link URL, which you can then copy
and forward to others as you see fit.  (In the near future, the system will itself automatically forward 
the created link to other contacts in your (yet-to-be-implemented) Synereo social graph).  The generated link 
retains knowledge of the URL it was generated from as a "parent link" - thus forming a chain of links back to the 
original content.

If you have already (re-)Amplifield the content previously, the link you created earlier will be displayed, 
and any investment you choose to make will simply be used to increase the balance in that link.

### Views

The amount you invested in the link will be used to make payments to other Synereo users who follow the link 
(ie. open the page). The viewer of the link will be paid 1 Amp for providing their attention.  
If link has a parent, that parent link will also get paid 1 Amp, and so on back up the chain. So if a link
has four parents, each view will decrement the balance by 5 - 1 to the viewer, and 1 to each of the parent
links.

If the viewer wishes, she can choose to Re-Amplify your created link.  The link created will have your
link as it's parent,  so that you will receive payment from any views generated by that link.

Once the balance in a link drops to zero, it will be automatically removed from the system 
(with any child links re-parented appropriately).

### Redeeming links

(NB - Not yet implemented.)

At any stage you can review all the links you currently have investments in, along with their current balances.
You can choose to "redeem" any such links, such that the balance will be transferred back into your account,
and the link removed.
